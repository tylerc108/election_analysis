## Overview of Election Audit

 For this project, we focused on analysing the results of a local senate election in Colorado for the Colorado Board of Elections. Essentially, we have the raw data in the form of a CSV (comma-separated values) file. With this CSV file, our task was to find several pieces of information: the total number of votes cast, the list of candidates in the election who received votes, the number of votes each candidate received, the percentage of votes each candidate received, the winner of the election based on popular vote, voter turnout for each county, percentage of total votes from each county, and the county with the highest voter turnout. This was quite a lot of values to find, so we also needed to organize these all into an output text file that was easy to read and understand. This output file and the whole of our analysis will help the Colorado Board of Elections

 The results of our analysis can be seen in the image below, which is a screenshot of the text file output of our code:
